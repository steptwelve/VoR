“The practice of making phone calls, even when you don’t have any particular reason, will make it easier when you need support. If you are having a difficult day, consider using the phone to do service.”

Like many, I have struggled reaching out when I’m hurting—I didn’t want to burden anybody. I had been sober in recovery for several years, active in step work and service; but there came an evening when I started to unravel. I was pacing the floor in my little two-room apartment, squirrel-caging, actually wearing a rut in the carpet. I was past being cognizant enough to call my sponsor or anyone else. I was, as they say, stark raving sober.

The phone rang. It was a guy from meetings. I barely knew him and there was no great rapport between us. He said his sponsor told him he had to call a different program person every day, and today he called me. I said something like, “Oh. So… how’s it going?” He gave a brief check-in. I don’t think I told him of my straits; I didn’t have the courage. It was a brief and civil, if not pleasant, exchange.

After he hung up, I realized I was back on earth among the living. His call snapped me out of my spiral. I know my Higher Power had him call me that day because I was too far-gone to seek help. By taking care of himself, he saved me.

It’s okay to call someone when I need help or just a friendly voice, and I never know whose life I might save.
