“Learning to seek the will of our Higher Power through group conscience takes time, patience, and good will. Love is the force that guides our service activities, rather than the familiar methods of human power and control.”

Sex Addicts Anonymous, page 80

To me, group conscience meetings are an important part of a group. During one of my first group conscience meetings, our group discussed an idea that I thought would allow newcomers to be better able to find our meeting. We had a vote, but the motion wasn’t approved. I felt disappointed and thought we were denying addicts an opportunity for help, but I knew that we would be all right.

In addition, my sponsor told me that he would continue to attend the meeting because he needed the meeting more than the meeting needed him. To me, this was an example of the principle of surrender by putting the group first and then letting God work in our groups. It is important for me to speak my conscience and to allow others to do the same. If it’s the right thing to do, it will eventually make itself apparent.

I find group consciences rewarding because I also feel a deeper connection to other recovering sex addicts and to the fellowship as a whole. In addition, I realize that a loving God is acting as the ultimate authority.

Grant me courage to speak the truth as I see it, and serenity to let others do the same.
