“As addicts, we were often all too ready to shirk responsibility and allow others to take care of us, clean up our messes, and attend to the necessities of life. In the program we learn instead to be accountable for ourselves and our recovery.”

Sex Addicts Anonymous, page 87

Early in recovery I considered the Seventh Tradition to be the money tradition. However, it is much more than money; in fact, it doesn’t even mention money.

We all come to the fellowship with gifts and talents. Sharing these with SAA allows our groups and the organization as a whole to be fully self-supporting. Local groups need fellowship members to serve as officers, set up rooms, make coffee, and welcome newcomers. Intergroups may need a fellowship member to help design and manage their website. Conferences and retreats need workshop presenters and speakers, and service opportunities abound, including KP duty, registration, and on-site sponsorship.

Of course, our groups and the organization need money to operate. When the basket is going around, I sometimes find myself balking at how much to put in. Two questions I was taught help me with this process. (i) How much would it be costing me if I were still practicing my addiction? (ii) How much is this new life worth to me?

Any act of service allows a group or event to operate without outside contributions and this allows the message of SAA to be carried to the still-suffering addict.

I will honor the Seventh Tradition with my time, talents, and treasures.
