“We have found that one of the reasons this process works so well is precisely because we do it ourselves.”

Sex Addicts Anonymous, page 83

When I first started attending SAA meetings, I felt pretty passive. I wasn’t sure what was going on, what was going to happen, and what was expected of me. As I kept coming back, however, I started to gain a sense of what meetings are about, what the service roles are in my groups, and what I can do to help.

I think it’s important to remember that Tradition Four not only liberates our groups from outside control, it also places the responsibility for the conduct of our groups squarely on each of us. There is no group without our individual service. Passivity is a natural place for a newcomer to start, but it’s not a place to stay. There are meetings to lead, business meetings to attend, phones to answer, members to sponsor, conferences to organize. If I leave these things for others to do, I am missing out on a vital element of recovery.

As we say, “It works if you work it.” Part of working it means being an active participant in my group and in SAA as a whole.

May I gratefully accept the autonomy, freedom, and responsibility that are mine as a member of SAA.
