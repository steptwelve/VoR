“Shame is a common experience for sex addicts. It is the feeling that we are never good enough, that there is something wrong with us, that we are bad people.”

Sex Addicts Anonymous, page 8

Before coming into the fellowship and working this solution, I had no other choice but to continue acting out in order to mask the pain. This perpetuated even more feelings of shame, guilt, and remorse.

I remind myself that when I follow the Steps, I enter into a relationship which is unconditional, all-loving, and caring. My creator has done the impossible. It was only when I had no other way out that grace held me and whispered, “I’ve got this. I love you. I forgive you.”
