“Over time, we establish a relationship with a Power greater than ourselves, each of us coming to an understanding of a Higher Power that is personal for us.”

Sex Addicts Anonymous, page 21

I grew up with an all-knowing, all-powerful God; an ever-present judge, always ready to condemn me for my errant behavior. Even my thoughts condemned me. As I became older, I felt that God was there just to deny me any fun in life, especially after I was deemed unfit for leadership by the religious community in which I had been raised. I was determined to show everyone, including God, and proceeded to do so for the next twenty-five years. Ten years ago, God had had enough and knocked me off my prideful perch.

I then returned to God as a refuge from my persecutors and a comfort from the shame and degradation that had become my life. God led me to SAA and the Twelve Steps of recovery. By working these steps I have come to a personal relationship with a loving and merciful God who cares for me just as I am, and who keeps me on the right track in my recovery.

The over-seven-billion of us in this world can form a loving, working relationship with a Higher Power in over seven billion different ways. I know that my Higher Power will be with me as long as I remain humble and open to guidance.

Thank you, God, for taking me as I am.
